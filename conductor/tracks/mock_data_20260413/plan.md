# Implementation Plan: Mock Data Generation Script

## Phase 1: Setup and Configuration [checkpoint: ff4d465]
- [x] Task: Configure Dependencies and Package.json [fa0de24]
    - [ ] Write failing test: Verify `@faker-js/faker` is installed and `prisma.seed` is configured in `package.json`.
    - [ ] Implement: Install `@faker-js/faker` as a dev dependency and update `package.json` with the Prisma seed command.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Setup and Configuration' (Protocol in workflow.md) [ff4d465]

## Phase 2: Mock Data Generators [checkpoint: 840b159]
- [x] Task: Create User and Property Generators [9e00b5f]
    - [ ] Write failing test: Create tests for `generateUsers` and `generateProperties` functions.
    - [ ] Implement: Write `generateUsers` and `generateProperties` using Faker.js.
    - [ ] Refactor: Optimize object generation logic.
- [x] Task: Create Message and Vector Embedding Generators [969643b]
    - [ ] Write failing test: Create tests for `generateMessages` and `generateEmbeddings` functions.
    - [ ] Implement: Write `generateMessages` and `generateEmbeddings` utilizing Faker.js and random float arrays.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Mock Data Generators' (Protocol in workflow.md) [840b159]

## Phase 3: Seeding Script Implementation
- [x] Task: Implement `prisma/seed.ts` execution logic [a9dda58]
    - [ ] Write failing test: Create an integration test verifying the database is correctly populated when seed functions are called.
    - [ ] Implement: Write `prisma/seed.ts` that sequentially clears the database (`deleteMany`), inserts records using generators, and safely disconnects the Prisma client.
